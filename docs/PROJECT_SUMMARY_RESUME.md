## **5. Portfolio Website Description**

**Project Name:** Enterprise College Management System
**Role:** Lead Full-Stack Engineer & DevOps Architect
**Status:** Production-Ready

**Overview:**
A comprehensive digital transformation tool for educational institutions, handling everything from student admission to staff payroll. The system replaces legacy paper-based workflows with a secure, centralized digital platform.

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
*   **Complexity Management:** Decomposed complex business logic into modular backend services using a clean architecture pattern.
*   **Deployment Consistency:** Eliminated "works on my machine" issues by containerizing the entire stack with Docker and managing configuration via environment variables.
*   **Data Integrity:** Enforced strict database integrity constraints and transaction management within MySQL to ensure zero data loss during critical operations like payroll processing.

**Impact:**
Demonstrates the capability to build, deploy, and maintain complex enterprise software, bridging the gap between development and operations.
